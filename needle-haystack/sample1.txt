Conclusion
This was all about the basics of streams. 
Streams, pipes, and chaining are the core and most 
powerful features in Node.js. Streams can indeed 
help you write neat and performant code to perform I/O.

Also, there is a Node.js strategic i
nitiative worth looking to, called BOB, 
aiming to improve Node.js streaming data interfaces, 
both within Node.js core internally, and hopefully also as future public APIs.
